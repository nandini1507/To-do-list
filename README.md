This project is a simple console-based To‑Do List application built in Python. It enables users to add, view, and remove tasks directly from the terminal, with all tasks stored in a text file to ensure persistence between sessions. The application demonstrates core Python concepts such as lists, file handling, string manipulation, and user input management. Designed as a beginner-friendly project, it highlights how everyday utilities can be created with just a few lines of code while reinforcing programming fundamentals.
