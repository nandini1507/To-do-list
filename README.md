#  To-Do List Application (Console-based)

##  Introduction
This project is a simple console-based To‑Do List application built in Python. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks directly from the terminal. Tasks are stored in a text file, ensuring persistence between sessions. The app demonstrates Python fundamentals such as lists, file handling, string manipulation, and user input management.

##  Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Remove tasks by number
- Persistent storage using a text file

##  Tools & Technologies
Python → The programming language used to build the app.

VS Code / Terminal → For writing and running the code.

Text File (tasks.txt)

## Core Concepts Applied
Lists → To hold tasks in memory (append, pop, insert).

File Handling → Using open() with modes (r, w, a) to read/write tasks.

String Manipulation → .strip() to clean user input and file lines.

Context Managers → with open(...) to safely handle files.

Loops & Conditionals → To display menus and process user choices.
