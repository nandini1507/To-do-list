# To-do-list
A simple console-based To‑Do List application built in Python. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks directly from the terminal. Tasks are stored in a text file, ensuring persistence between sessions. The project demonstrates Python fundamentals such as lists, file handling, string manipulation, and user input management.
